Programming Experience: 


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


We did some things with arduinos, basic python things such as syntax and then we got into a bit of html with website design and vr worlds. 
We created different simulations in python, such as a coin flip simulator and the turtle drawing. 


10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


Yikes this is hard to remember. We designed a game, but with a lot of help from Mr. Best. Mostly exploring text based games and that sort of interaction
with users. We did some experimenting with VR but it was more on the user side. 




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I want to just get better at using my resources to be able to create my own things, but really I want to get better at the more
technical aspect of music production, which in a way is programming. I also want to really lean into my curiosity and develope that. 


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

I think sometimes I get lost in loops of being limited in my own knowlege, so realizing I can use resources and my "piecing together" skills to figure things out.
I tend to like how it is somewhat tedious, but I am definately challenged when it comes to really creating my own things and drawing upon past knowlege. 


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


For me it's all about thinking in different ways, knowing how to use resources and really be able to create useful things. I really like how it's such a useful skill that I
know I will draw upon in the future, but it will probably not be a main path, but will most definitely be a part of that path, just based on how the world is evolving.
